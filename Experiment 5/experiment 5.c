//Write a C program utilizing OpenMP directives to demonstrate the behavior of the private clause.
//The program should perform the following steps:
//Initialize OpenMP with 4 threads.
//Declare an integer variable val and initialize it to a value of 1234.
//Print the initial value of val outside the OpenMP parallel region.
//Enter an OpenMP parallel region using the omp parallel directive, with the firstprivate clause applied to the variable val.
//Inside the parallel region, each thread should print the current value of val, increment it by 1, and then print the updated value.
//Print the final value of val outside the parallel region.
